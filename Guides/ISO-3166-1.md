# ISO 3166-1(alpha-2)

A region designator is a code that represents a country (ISO 3166-1 standard, two-letter, capitalized code). To specify a specific dialect, use a hyphen to combine a language designator with a region designator. For example, to specify common English, use the en language designator as locale.

To specify the **English** language as it is used in the **United Kingdom**, use `en-GB` as the locale.
